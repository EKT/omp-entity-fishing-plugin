##Installation Guide

###Prerequisites

1) PHP Multibyte String: http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php
2) PHP Apache Solr: http://php.net/manual/en/book.solr.php
3) Apache Solr: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
4) [**Optional**] Nerd: https://github.com/kermitt2/entity-fishing (You can install your own NERD instance or you can use the public one here: http://nerd.huma-num.fr/nerd/)

###Installation

1) Download the plugin files from this repository

2) Place them inside your OMP installation in the followin path:

	`{base_omp_installation_dir}/plugins/generic`
	
3) Move to this path and run the following command:

	`./composer.phar install`
	
	The plugin uses the following third party libraries that the aforementioned command is going to install:
	
	1) lotsofcode/tag-cloud: https://packagist.org/packages/lotsofcode/tag-cloud
	2) hirmeos/entity-fishing-php-wrapper: https://packagist.org/packages/hirmeos/entity-fishing-php-wrapper
	
**IMPORTANT**: For the time, there is also a small hack that you need to make in order for the plugin to function well. You have to go to the file in the path:

`{base_omp_installation_dir}/templates/controllers/tab/workflow/production.tpl`

and add the following line before the last two `div`'s:

`{call_hook name="Templates::Workflow::production"}`

After these steps, you will be able to use the plugin!
